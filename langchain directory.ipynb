I thrive \\non learning new technologies, frameworks and the latest advancements in the field. My approach involves continuous \\nresearch to identify and implement innovative and efficient coding solutions \\n \\nORGANIZATIONAL EXPERIENCE \\n \\nOrganization   Duration     Location   Role \\nRelentless systems  July 2022 to present.                                Bangalore  Software engineer \\n \\nA leading software development company in providing expert IT solutions to its global clients, focusing on enterprise \\nsolutions, and e-commerce solutions. My contribution is to Develop and review Python code for new application features, \\nidentified and debugged critical issues, contributing to a reduction in system errors and improving application stability \\n \\nASSIGNMENT HIGHLIGHTS \\n      Execute Django application  scripts, prepare and manage developed data \\nTitle    GenoEncrypt \\n \\nTools: MYSQL for reliable data storage.  HashiCorp Vault  for key management and OAuth 2.0  for secure \\nauthentication. For scalability and monitoring, tools like Redis and Prometheus are used to handle \\nlarge volumes of genetic data and system performance tracking. \\n \\nBrief: Developed GenoEncrypt, a secure system for transmitting genetic data, by implementing advanced \\nencryption protocols to safeguard information during transit. Integrated biometric authentication to \\nenhance security and ensure user verification. Designed real -time monitoring features to track data \\nintegrity and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. Utilized JavaScript, ReactJS,  and \\nPython to build a robust, reliable, and compliant data transmission platform. This project significantly \\nenhanced the security of sensitive genetic information and streamlined data handling processes. \\n                                            \\nRole: (Backend): Develop secure APIs and communication channels using Django Channels to ensure data \\nintegrity during transmission. (Frontend): Build an intuitive interface with secure, real-time communication \\nusing ReactJS and WebSockets. \\nDesign the architecture to ensure encrypted, real-time secure transmission of genetic data. Implement \\ncutting-edge encryption algorithms to protect sensitive genetic information during transmission. \\nContinuously monitor data transmissions for unauthorized access and mitigate any security threats. \\nEnsure compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA, particularly in securing \\ngenetic data. \\n \\nTitle:    GenoLegit   \\n \\nTools: MYSQL for reliable and scalable data storage. Implementing OAuth 2.0 and Auth0 will ensure robust \\nauthentication and authorization, while HashiCorp Vault  guarantees secure encryption and key \\nmanagement. For compliance and monitoring, tools like OneTrust and ELK Stack are ideal for audit \\ntrails and regulatory adherence \\n \\nBrief: Project is designed to ensure that the handling of sensitive genetic data adheres to regulatory \\nstandards and ethical guidelines. The project focuses on compliance with global data protection laws \\nensuring the secure and lawful management of genetic information. A key aspect is the \\nimplementation of consent management systems, ensuring that user consent is obtained and verified \\nbefore any access to genetic data. \\n \\nRole: Build user interfaces that ensure effective consent management and ethical access to genetic data \\nusing ReactJS. \\nImplement encryption and access controls in the database to safeguard genetic data and ensure \\nregulatory compliance. \\nEstablish and maintain detailed audit trails to monitor data access and manage compliance with \\ndata protection regulations.Provide ongoing system support to ensure reliability, address any issues, \\nand report progress and resolution status to management.
